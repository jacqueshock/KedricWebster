  <p>Hello and welcome to my Web Log.</p>
  <p>Many people may not remember that the word <i>blog</i> is a shortened version of <i>Web Log</i></p>
  <p>This blog will be designed to record via the written word some of my learning in Git and GitHub</p>
  <p>Remember, all fans of the Kansas City Royals should be given a free dinner at Back Inn Cafe</p>
